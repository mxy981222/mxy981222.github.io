						<h2>Self-analysis</h2>
						<p>Strengths: </p>
						<p>
							- I am a patient and persistent person. When I met some difficulty,
							I will try my best to tackle it no matter how long it takes. 
						<br>
							- I am rational. I seldom make decisions based on my emotion, 
							instead, I can step out of my feelings and do things objectively. 
						<br>
							- I am also optimistic. Once when I was a sophomore with low GPA, 
							I cheered myself up in a short period and did my best to study hard and gradually obtained a high GPA at the end. 
						</p>
						<p>Weaknesses: </p>
						<p>
							- I lack self-discipline. I always play video games 
							till late night rather than sleep earlier even though I know it is bad to my health. 
						<br>
							- I am not good at communication and making friends. 
							I never attend parties and I do not have much friends. And I am also afraid of talking to others. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As a Meng ECE student aiming to work as a Software Engineer, I believe my strengths can let me develop
							great technical skills, which is an essential aspect to become a Software Engineer. However, I still need
							to work on improving my self-discipline and communication skills, since these aspects can help me in the 
							long run, not only as a Software Engineer but also a healthy person.

							<h2>External analysis</h2>
							<p>
								My family and friends said that I am a kind person and dedicate in everything I determined to do. They also said that 
								I have to sleep earlier because a healthy body is important in the long run. Moreover, they told me that sometimes I 
								could be very strict on them, when they said something wrong even if it is just a detail, I will say a lot to tell them 
								they are wrong.

							<h2>Congruency analysis</h2>
							<p>
								According to self-analysis and external analysis, we all agree on that I am persistent and dedicated. 
								However, my family and friends also told me that I am harsh on them. After thinking though it, I think
								it is because I am a rational person and I treat myself and them in the same way. In this way, I believe 
								I am too rational and can bother my family and friends. This is the first time that I understand that 
								rationality can give others a hard time. I will work hard to improve on this.
